# Edgar Dzhagarian

### About Me
My name is Edgar. I work as a marketing analyst in an IT company. I have always been interested in web development and in IT in general but trusted a stereotype that only certain types of people may achieve great goals in the industry. Luckily, once I tried to dive into coding, I figured out that it is possible to learn if you take your time and like it. 
Now I'm passionately interested in improving my skills as a frontend developer and can't wait to start a career in this field.
